# Effective Teaching

## What?

In the progressing teacher course, I have learned that effective teaching draws upon many different skills and areas. I've categorized my effective teaching learnings into the following categories:
 - Preparation
 - In the classroom
 - Outside the classroom

### Preparation
#### Openers & Closers
Opening and closing can be instrumental in helping your students stay focused and gain intrinsic motivation to learn from your class. While this is important in a lesson plan, we can also apply this to the course as a whole. Starting and driving interest at the beginning of the semester sets the tone for the whole semester.

For a course, one way to have a great opener is to *kill syllabus day* by creating a quiz and giving students the opportunity to get to know each other as they work on the quiz together. We can then spend the time we'd normally take covering critical syllabus material on in interesting demo or activity which introduces the course material and shares our excitement for it.

To close out the semester well, we should do activities which can renew the students' enthusiasm for the topic and helps them see what's different now that they've learned some cool stuff.

For each lesson, we should also follow the same principle of having good openings and closings. These can help focus student attention that we can use to help our students learn. At the end of our lessons, doing an activity to solidify the concepts we talked about that day will help with retention of the material and can help generate motivation to attend every class.

#### Getting and Holding Attention

I learned from *Distracted Why Students Can't Focus and What You Can Do About It* by [James Lang](https://www.jamesmlang.com/books) that attention is an active part of class teaching and that as educators we need to be proactive in seeking and renewing our students attention in our classes. The technology companies spend the majority of their time finding ways to keep our attention on their platform and products they promote. Educators need to be even better at helping our students focus in our learning activities.

### In the classroom
My learning for being an effective teacher in the classroom centered around our principles found in the [BYU-Idaho Learning Model](https://www.byui.edu/learning-model/). We need to teach by the Spirit. We can prepare and be ready to answer all of our students questions, but the timing of which answers would be best - including providing encouragement to the student to find the answer on their own - is most effective when influenced by the Holy Ghost. The Spirit teaches and brings things to our students' remembrance, so if the Spirit is present in our classrooms and the students have the opportunity to learn by the Spirit, they will retain the information better. We can model correct behavior to our students by teaching by the Spirit.

### Outside the classroom
Outside the classroom, we have a responsibility to guide our students. Elder Bednar talked about being natural mentors to our students. Research has shown that when students have a mentor, they have a significantly better college experience. Additionally, the best way we can help our students to be disciples of Jesus Christ is through teaching them as he did - with love, charity, and one by one. Although we don't need to reach every student, we may be the only one who can reach *that* student. We connect with students by sharing our own humanity, experiences, and love with the students. One question that I've really enjoyed asking students as they come in is, "What brought you here to BYU-Idaho?" Often this helps me learn about my students' backgrounds. Another important part of mentoring is know each student's name. When you don't know the names of the students, they feel as if nobody will care if I'm there or not.  

## So What?

With the learning from this course, what does it mean? I've already starting implementing openers and closers in my daily lessons; however, I have some work to do in beginning and ending the semester well.

The largest impact in my daily classroom has been applying the principles of attention from [James Lang](https://www.jamesmlang.com/books)'s book. I've changed up activities in the classroom and focused on learning all of my student's names. I've implemented activities to build community among the students so that they can lift and support each other.

In each of my classes, I have tried to integrate lessons from the Book of Mormon and the Bible from my daily study with the material so that there are examples that the students can see of discipleship and application of the scriptures to their lives. I seek to bring the Holy Ghost through the scriptures into the classroom so that we can all be taught together. I know that I've felt prompted to share certain experiences with my students in one section of a course that I don't necessarily share with others because the Spirit says someone in here needs it.

In my mentoring, I have tried to know all of my students through one on one meetings. After learning about mentoring, I changed up the schedule of my courses so that I had a chance to meet with each student one on one. I will plan to do this again next semester

## Now What?
**Preparation**

- [ ] [Create a syllabus quiz for 212](https://github.com/kaychoro/progressing-teacher-summary/issues/2)
- [ ] [Review lesson openers for 180](https://github.com/kaychoro/progressing-teacher-summary/issues/3)
- [ ] [Help the semester end with bang for our students in 180](https://github.com/kaychoro/progressing-teacher-summary/issues/4)
- [ ] [Help the semester end with bang for our students in 212](https://github.com/kaychoro/progressing-teacher-summary/issues/5)

**In the classroom**
- [ ] Consider additional ways to democratize participation

**Outside the classroom**
