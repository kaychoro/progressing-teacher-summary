# Effective Teaching

## What?

In the progressing teacher course, I found that effective teaching draws upon many different skills and areas. The areas that I've learned in fall into a few categories:
 - Preparation
 - In the classroom
 - Outside the classroom

### Preparation
#### Openers & Closers
Opening and closing can be instrumental in helping your students stay focused and gain intrinsic motivation to learn from your class. While this is important in a lesson plan, we can also apply this to the course as a whole. Starting and driving interest at the beginning of the semester sets the tone for the whole semester.

In each lesson, I try to begin class with a prayer and a scripture that relates to the topic that we'll cover that day.

#### Getting and holding attention

### In the classroom
 - Teaching by the Spirit

### Outside the classroom
 - Mentoring â€“ connecting with students one on one
