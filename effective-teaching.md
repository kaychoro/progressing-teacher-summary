# Effective Teaching

## What?

In the progressing teacher course, I found that effective teaching draws upon many different skills and areas. The areas that I've learned in fall into a few categories:
 - Preparation
 - In the classroom
 - Outside the classroom

### Preparation
#### Openers & Closers
Opening and closing can be instrumental in helping your students stay focused and gain intrinsic motivation to learn from your class. While this is important in a lesson plan, we can also apply this to the course as a whole. Starting and driving interest at the beginning of the semester sets the tone for the whole semester.

For a course, one way to have a great opener is to *kill syllabus day* by creating a quiz and giving students the opportunity to get to know each other as they work on the quiz together. We can then spend the time we'd normally take covering critical syllabus material on in interesting demo or activity which introduces the course material and shares our excitement for it.

To close out the semester well, we should do activities which can renew the students' enthusiasm for the topic and helps them see what's different now that they've learned some cool stuff.

For each lesson, we should also follow the same principle of having good openings and closings. These can help focus student attention that we can use to help our students learn.

, I try to begin class with a prayer and a scripture that relates to the topic that we'll cover that day.

#### Getting and holding attention

### In the classroom
 - Teaching by the Spirit

### Outside the classroom
 - Mentoring â€“ connecting with students one on one
