# Learning Outcomes

## What?
See [BYU-Idaho Learning Outcomes](https://www.byui.edu/byu-idaho-learning-outcomes)

## So What?
We need to be explicit in teaching our students about the learning outcomes. It's helpful to identify one or two learning outcomes for each course that you expect the students to build throughout the course - and then tell them that!

#### Courses that I teach to Learning Outcomes
Course  | Learning Outcomes
------- | ------------------
CSE 180 | Sound Thinkers; Effective Communicators
CSE 212 | Effective Communicators

## Now What?
- [ ] [Add content to the beginning of the semester that identifies the learning outcomes we want them to build in the course](https://github.com/kaychoro/progressing-teacher-summary/issues/7)
